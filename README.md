# Metro2

Flat, minimalist, and striking in color, this style has a sleek, quick, modern, and refresh look.

Metro2 is a spiritual successor of MetroGreen, a [FluxBB style](https://web.archive.org/web/20130217173856/http://fluxbb.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=6372) 
made by Studio384 that people just love to hate (no offense). Just like how MetroGreen is just the Classic Elements style put on a MDLinator, 
Metro2 is just Curve2 -- the default style of SMF -- but with the Microsoft Design Language put into it... sort of.
(please don't tell me the inaccuracies, I haven't daily drived Windows since ages)

While I think it still looks kinda jarring, at least it's not as jarring as MetroGreen :)
